	<Message ID="invite_msg_3" Subject="UCLA Specialists' Survey">
		<p>This is an invitation to the final part of a survey evaluating
			UCLA primary care physicians. This survey is your chance to
			acknowledge those who do a great job and to inform those who need
			improvement. You are among the specialists who have not responded to
			part 1 of the survey. We have now combined parts 1 and 2 of the
			survey together so that you can complete it all at once.</p>
		<p>Please start the survey by clicking on the Web address below.
			Specialists who have already completed the survey commented that they
			enjoyed giving this feedback. The survey should take about 5 minutes,
			but may take more or less depending on how many physicians you decide
			to evaluate. If you have comments or questions, please contact Joann
			Damiani at jdamiani@mednet.ucla.edu. </p>

		<p>Thank you very much!</p>
